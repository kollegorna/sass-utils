# Kollegorna's SASS utilities

A starter package for every SASS project.

## Usage

1. Install with `npm install --save`
2. Include `src/_all.scss` in your project. What it does:
  - Makes all of the SASS utilities available
  - Injects Reset CSS

## Development

Run `gulp` when developing. This will:

- Run the linter for your own good
- Generate `reset.css` file for non-SASS projects

## Else...

For now, browse `src/*` to get to know the utilities. Documentation are on the way...
